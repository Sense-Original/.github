### About Us

<div align="center"><b>In a world of first copies and fakes, identifying the</br>product authencity is</br>customers biggest problem.</br></b></div>


Sense Original collaborates with brands and sells the tags directly to them. These tags are sent to the manufacturing site and then directly install to the products at production, ensuring only authentic goods are being dispatched.

- **Real-World Scenarios**

   India has a big market for counterfeits, whether it's shoes, bags, accessories, cosmetics, clothes or electronics. Everything from the packaging, colour, paperwork and tags is made to imitate the original. But in time, the quality of the product gives away and reality sets in.
   
- **What do Brands Gain From Us?**
 
   Being an aggregator, our cost of production of the tags is much lower than what a brand would pay individually.
Along with the economies of cost, we would also be spending on educating the customer and spending awareness about counterfeit products, thereby assisting the brands in maintaining the integrity of their products, promoting their sales and disrupting the market for fake products.
